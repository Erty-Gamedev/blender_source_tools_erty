# Blender Source Tools (Erty)

A fork of Blender Source Tools version 3.2.5 with various fixes and changes
to improve its use for GoldSrc modelling.

## Installation

Just the same as with the original BST. Grab the latest zip archive from [Releases](releases) but *do not* unzip it.

Instead go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons and hit Install... near the top-right of the window and navigate to and select the zip archive. Afterwards scroll down the list and find `Import-Export: Blender Source Tools` and activate it.

## Changes

* `Implicit motionless bone` checkbox is now unchecked by default (prevents unexpected skeletal hierarchy changes)
